# Component 3: Identification and Justification of UML Diagrams

## Selected UML Diagrams

### 1. Use Case Diagram

**Purpose:**  
Represents the functional interactions between the system and external actors (Students/Visitors, Admin).

**Justification:**  
Provides a high-level overview of what the system should do from a userâ€™s perspective, making it easier to identify functional requirements.

---

### 2. Activity Diagram

**Purpose:**  
Shows the dynamic workflow of the system, e.g., selecting a destination and receiving directions.

**Justification:**  
Suitable for modeling the step-by-step process of navigation, helping to visualize decision points and possible paths.

---

### 3. Class Diagram

**Purpose:**  
Represents the static structure of the system including classes such as App, UI, Destination, Route, TTS Engine, and their relationships.

**Justification:**  
Essential for translating requirements into a design structure that will later guide software development.

---

### 4. Sequence Diagram

**Purpose:**  
Illustrates the interaction between system objects over time, such as the process of a student selecting a destination and the app generating directions.

**Justification:**  
Shows the order of operations and the communication between different system components, which is vital for understanding system logic.

## Rationale for Choosing Four Diagrams

These four diagrams (**Use Case**, **Activity**, **Class**, **Sequence**) collectively provide a comprehensive system view:

- **Use Case:** What the system does (user perspective).
- **Activity:** How the process flows.
- **Class:** System structure and data.
- **Sequence:** System interactions and logic.

This set is adequate because it covers both static (structure) and dynamic (behavior) aspects of the system.

Adding more diagrams (e.g., Deployment) could be beneficial but may not be strictly necessary for this scope.
